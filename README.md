![So do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior; and Allah is with you and will never deprive you of [the reward of] your deeds. Muhammad [47:35] - Quran](assets/Quran-Muhammad-Aya35-AR+EN.png "Muhammad [47:35] - Quran")

Read Quran [Surah Muhammad [47:19]](http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/47:35)


## Story

After the [1979 Islamic Revolution](https://english.khamenei.ir/Opinions/IRevolution), heavy [US-led international sanctions](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/pages/iran.aspx) were imposed to put pressure on the people and the government to prevent Iran from moving toward benevolent goals. Most of these sanctions were based on false pretenses such as Iran's access to nuclear weapons and support for terrorism. They are forming and feeding ISIS against you at a heavy cost. And then shamelessly admit it. When you overthrow the ISIS government, the resistance commanders are cowardly assassinated. And strangely enough, then they call your commander a terrorist and you a terrorist nation. They safeguard the killers of thousands of Iranians and hold conferences with them to overthrow the "Iranian regime". At the same time, they prevent you from defending. Is this really human rights?


Although your country is being boycotted under various pretexts, the sanctions do not end here. Sanctions are not limited to government organizations and groups, but affect the lives of all Iranians living there. In this list, we will see a number of Internet sanctions that have affected technology, computers and programming in related fields.

See: [US Treasury sanctions against Iran](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/pages/iran.aspx)
